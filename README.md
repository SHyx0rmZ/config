# config

This repository contains a bunch of shell scripts that configure a Debian
install to my likings. I figured it was finally time to set up one of these.

To get started, run:

    bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SHyx0rmZ/config/master/config)

After this initial installation, `config` will be made available in your `PATH`.
